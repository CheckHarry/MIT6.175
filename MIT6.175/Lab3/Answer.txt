Q1:
By the test bench , unsigned integer is not equal to signed integer.

Q2:
Basically the compiler fail to do type deduction on generic function.
line "function Bit#(16) test_function( Bit#(8) a, Bit#(8) b ) = multiply_unsigned( a, b );"
tell the compiler that the ref_function two operand type are both Bit#(8).
