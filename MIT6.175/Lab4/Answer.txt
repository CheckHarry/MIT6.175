Q1:

enq :
enqP : RW
deqP : R
isEmpty : W
isFull  : W

deq :
enqP : R
deqP : RW
isEmpty : W
isFull  : W

first :
isEmpty : R
deqP : R

enq < deq because deqP
and
deq < enq because enqP

so enq and deq are conflict

for first , first < enq and first < deq because of isEmpty

Q2: as a result , the conflict matrix is
      first enq deq clear
first X     <   <   <
end   >     X   C   C
deq   >     C   X   C
clear >     C   C   X


Q4. 
as 
enq() read notFull[0]
and
deq() read notEmpty[0]

so in clear , setting writing to notFull[1] and notEmpty[1] will result as {enq , deq} < clear
