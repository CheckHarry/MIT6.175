How many gates does your one-bit multiplexer use? The 5-bit multiplexer? Write down a formula for the number of gates in an N-bit multiplexer. (2 Points)
Ans: It use 4 logic gates. And the 5-bit multiplexer use 5 * 4 logic gates. And in general N-bit multiplexer use 4 * N logic gates.

Assume a single full adder requires 5 gates. How many gates does the 8-bit ripple-carry adder require? How many gates does the 8-bit carry-select adder require? (2 Points)
Ans: 10 logic gates.

Assume a single full adder requires A time unit to compute its outputs once all its inputs are valid and a mux requires M time unit to compute its output. 
In terms of A and M, how long does the 8-bit ripple-carry adder take? How long does the 8-bit carry-select adder take? (2 Points)
Ans: 
Ripple-carry adder contains no multiplexer and the time it takes will be 2 * A.
Carry-select adder parallelize two upper and lower add. And emit the result right after a multiplexer , so the answer will be A + M.
